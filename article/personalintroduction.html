				<h2>Personal introduction</h2>
				<p>Hello my name is Claire and I am from Beijing, China. I am passionate about capturing the beauty of life and landscapes through my lens, which is why I got into this business in the first place. I love to travel because I want to be free and live in strange places, and I love to capture beautiful moments on camera, so I offer not only travel photography, but also personal portraits, wedding photography and more.</p>
