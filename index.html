                <h3>Landscapes in the world</h3>
                <!-- <img src="img/top.webp" alt="Top_pic"> -->
                <p>I have always believed in the power of landscape. If you are in a bad mood, stressed from work and your eyes and body feel tired, you will feel much better if you go to even the nearest natural landscape around you, such as the forest and the sea. I personally love the snow and the sea, and the snowbound and the seaside are two places that have a very high rate to get a great photo.</p>

			       <h3>Dynamic and static</h3>
			       <video controls  src="video/video.MOV"></video>
			           <p>I believe that both static beauty and dynamic beauty are essential, whether the subject is a person or a landscape, so my travel photography will provide you with two forms of deliverables, a carefully shot video and a set of carefully composed and retouched photographs.</p>

			       <p>I fell in love with travel photography after watching this video blogger's videos, it's very romantic and fulfilling to be able to take pictures and video people in beautiful natural landscapes.</p>

                <h2>About this website:</h2>
                <p>I built this site to seek empathy from people who love landscapes and photography as much as I do, so if you have a need to take great photos but don't know what to do yet, feel free to come to me and we can have an in-depth conversation about it!</p>
                <p>I've always thought it would be really cool to work for what I love and I have a favourite wedding photography site that is <a href="https://www.victoria-photography.co.uk/destination-weddings/"> victoria-photography</a>, I think has soul in their photos.</p>
                <p>I will also go further and further along the path of experience in filming, to follow the steps of my favourite volger and others who have do it before me, in order to reach my ambition of supporting myself with my hobby sooner.</p>
